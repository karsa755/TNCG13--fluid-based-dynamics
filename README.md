# TNCG13 Honey Simulation
Project in the course TNCG13, SFX - Tricks of the Trade. The project was made by Rebecca Cedermalm and Karim Samim Karim 
through pairprogramming.

Fluid simulations are important components for effects in film and games. In nature almost all fluids are viscous which makes 
viscoelastic fluids especially interesting to simulate. This project uses the Position Based Fluid method to simulate how honey moves 
and acts when falling into a box. The Position Based Fluid simulation method is an integration of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics 
method into the Particle Based Dynamics framework. Materials, lights and environments were added to the simulation to make the it look 
visually pleasing. The result is stable and realistically simulates the motion of honey.
